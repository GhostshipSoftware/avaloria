Mountain tops are the home of these ruddy short people. They have a sense of balance that 
seemingly defies gravity. The colder air of the mountains has shaped this race in many ways 
while defining their culture and crafting. They are able to be very industrious when a task 
is set before them, but are also quick with a laugh and joke. The society revolves around 
the family and is matriarchal in structure.
