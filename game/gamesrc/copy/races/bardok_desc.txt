--{rThe Bardok{n--
Dark-skinned and dark-minded, this very secretive society has always been just outside the 
range of the general population. Rumors abound about what really goes on in their hideaways. 
They could be assassins for hire, or necromancers, or anything that is never seen but only fleetingly felt. 
Always being in perpetual shadows and twilight, have given this race undeniable stealth and patience.
