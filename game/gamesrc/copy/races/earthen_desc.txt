--{rThe Earthen{n--
One of the oldest races, they are fair haired and tend to be physically imposing in both 
structure and timbre. They are workers who have lived their entire lives underground mining 
for the metals and gems needed for others. They are light skinned due to the constant toiling 
in the earth and they prefer to their underground cities to live in and remember the past when 
the metals flowed like water through their realm.
