--{rThe Gerdling{n--
There has always been Gerdlings but no one can agree when they became what they are today - 
preeminent traders of the land. There society is based on the art of the deal and the acquisition 
of wealth. Money talks throughout this society and they are nomadic as they pursue opportunities. 
They have a medium build and can show an amazing array of hairstyles and colors. These hairstyles 
reflect the confidence and importance of the wearer. The greatest shame to a Gerdling, besides losing 
a trade, is being shorn of their hair.
