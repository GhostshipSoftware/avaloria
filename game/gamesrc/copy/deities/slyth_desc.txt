--{rSlyth of the Glade{n---
Since the great receding of the glaciers created the glades there has been an energy and vitality 
that coalesced into Slyth. Quick and flexible as the tall grasses in the wind, Slyth has a mercurial 
quality to his view of what is right. He is absolute that the glades remain pure and undisturbed.
