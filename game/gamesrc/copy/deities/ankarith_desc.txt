--{rAn'karith the Eternal Night Bringer{n--
As long as there has been a night sky, there has been An'Karith. The moon glows red periodically 
on Avaloria from the pulsing magic of his rune-traced Hammer. An'Karith can take on many forms, 
from a human to a simple house fly, he can be anywhere and nowhere all at once. He is the oldest 
of the God's and attempts to keep the peace between the warring, younger, less experienced Deities.
