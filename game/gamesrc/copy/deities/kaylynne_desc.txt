In the sound of the crashing waves and the smell of the seashore after low tide, you will find the 
essence of the demi-goddess Kaylynne. She is very young on the godly timescale, and currently only 
has one worshiper. Her existence in a corporeal way is bound to her worshiper. This has set up an 
interesting dynamic not replicated anywhere else in Avaloria.
