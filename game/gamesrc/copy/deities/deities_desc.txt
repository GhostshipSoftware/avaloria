--{rDeities of Avaloria{n--
There are quite a few deities and demi-god creatures within the land of Avaloria. No entity really 
knows, or is responsible for the creation of the universe, and as such there is no unifying deity. 
Many of the God's of the world are ancient souls who have been around since near the Dawn of Time. 
Choosing to devote yourself to a deity has it's benefits, though depending on which you choose, 
it may have some consequences as well.
