--{rThe Green Warden{n--
Oldest of the natural spirits, the Warden can be viewed as the conscious of the Forest. He is the 
physical manifestation of the trees and may appear in many forms depending on the needs of the forest. 
Most encounters have been with an elderly man who is dressed in a variety of green garments. This aspect 
takes a teacher role to aid in the understanding of the forest and it's needs.

The Green Warden and Sylth have a very strained relationship to say the very least. The edges of their 
domains are very contested and this affects all involved.
