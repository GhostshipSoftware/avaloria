This directory holds log files for the server.

portal.log        - logs from Portal (if run in daemon mode)
server.log        - logs from Server (if run in daemon mode)
http_requests.log - http request info (if running webserver/client)

All log files are rotated to their *.old version when the server is fully
stopped, then restarted again (i.e. not on normal reloads).
