Evennia translations
--------------------

This folder contains data for translating Evennia's 
core messages to different languages. Note that commands
are not covered here at this time. 



Changing server language
------------------------

To change the server to use a supported language,
edit your settings file and add the following: 

 USE_I18N = True 
 LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'

Change 'en' to a translated language (see which are available
in evennia/locale/). Restart Server and Portal. 



Creating a new translation
--------------------------

evennia/locale/ contains translation strings for the core server.

First look to see if there is already data files for 
your language available to improve upon. If not, you can
start translate for a new language by placing yourself in 
Evennia's root directory and run 

  django-admin makemessages -l <language code>

where <language code> is the two-letter locale code for the language 
you want, like "sv" for Swedish, "es" for Spanish and so on. A new
folder with the language code will have appeared. 


Doing a translation / improving an existing one
-----------------------------------------------

Go to locale/<language code>/LC_MESSAGES/and edit the *.po file 
you find there by translating each given English string to the equivalent in 
the other language. Editing the raw file manually is not necessary -- search 
the web and you'll find many open-source graphical .po editors available.

Once you have modified the .po file to add/correct the translation therein,
you must compile it for efficiency. Back in Evennia's root directory, run

  django-admin compilemessages

This will create a binary .mo file which is what Evennia will use. 


Let us know! 
------------

If you did a new translation or improved an old one, please consider sending
us your updated .po file so we can include it with the main Evennia distribution!
