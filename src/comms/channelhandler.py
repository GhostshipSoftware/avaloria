"""
The channel handler handles the stored set of channels
and how they are represented against the cmdhandler.

If there is a channel named 'newbie', we want to be able
to just write

> newbie Hello!

For this to work, 'newbie', the name of the channel, must
be identified by the cmdhandler as a command name. The
channelhandler stores all channels as custom 'commands'
that the cmdhandler can import and look through.

Warning - channel names take precedence over command names,
so make sure to not pick clashing channel names.

Unless deleting a channel you normally don't need to bother about
the channelhandler at all - the create_channel method handles the update.

To delete a channel cleanly, delete the channel object, then call
update() on the channelhandler. Or use Channel.objects.delete() which
does this for you.
