        can connect to a Character Object in order to "enter" the
        game.

        Player Typeclass API:

        * Available properties (only available on initiated typeclass objects)

         key (string) - name of player
         name (string)- wrapper for user.username
         aliases (list of strings) - aliases to the object. Will be saved to
                            database as AliasDB entries but returned as strings.
         dbref (int, read-only) - unique #id-number. Also "id" can be used.
         dbobj (Player, read-only) - link to database model. dbobj.typeclass
                                     points back to this class
         typeclass (Player, read-only) - this links back to this class as an
                          identified only. Use self.swap_typeclass() to switch.
         date_created (string) - time stamp of object creation
         permissions (list of strings) - list of permission strings

         user (User, read-only) - django User authorization object
         obj (Object) - game object controlled by player. 'character' can also
                        be used.
         sessions (list of Sessions) - sessions connected to this player
         is_superuser (bool, read-only) - if the connected user is a superuser

        * Handlers

         locks - lock-handler: use locks.add() to add new lock strings
         db - attribute-handler: store/retrieve database attributes on this
                                 self.db.myattr=val, val=self.db.myattr
         ndb - non-persistent attribute handler: same as db but does not
                                     create a database entry when storing data
         scripts - script-handler. Add new scripts to object with scripts.add()
         cmdset - cmdset-handler. Use cmdset.add() to add new cmdsets to object
