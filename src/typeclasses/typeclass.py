"""
A typeclass is the companion of a TypedObject django model.
It 'decorates' the model without actually having to add new
fields to the model - transparently storing data onto its
associated model without the admin/user just having to deal
with a 'normal' Python class. The only restrictions is that
the typeclass must inherit from TypeClass and not reimplement
the get/setters defined below. There are also a few properties
that are protected, so as to not overwrite property names
used by the typesystem or django itself.
