"""
This module gathers all the essential database-creation
functions for the game engine's various object types.

Only objects created 'stand-alone' are in here, e.g. object Attributes
are always created directly through their respective objects.

Each creation_* function also has an alias named for the entity being
created, such as create_object() and object().  This is for
consistency with the utils.search module and allows you to do the
shorter "create.object()".

The respective object managers hold more methods for manipulating and
searching objects already existing in the database.

Models covered:
 Objects
 Scripts
 Help
 Message
 Channel
 Players
