This is a convenient container gathering all the main
search methods for the various database tables.

It is intended to be used e.g. as

> from src.utils import search
> match = search.objects(...)

Note that this is not intended to be a complete listing of all search
methods! You need to refer to the respective manager to get all
possible search methods. To get to the managers from your code, import
the database model and call its 'objects' property.

Also remember that all commands in this file return lists (also if
there is only one match) unless noted otherwise.

Example: To reach the search method 'get_object_with_player'
         in src/objects/managers.py:

> from src.objects.models import ObjectDB
> match = Object.objects.get_object_with_player(...)

#
#        Search globally or in a list of candidates and return results.
#        The result is always a list of Objects (or the empty list)
#
#        Arguments:
#        ostring: (str) The string to compare names against. By default (if
#                  not attribute_name is set), this will search object.key
#                  and object.aliases in order. Can also be on the form #dbref,
#                  which will, if exact=True be matched against primary key.
#        attribute_name: (str): Use this named ObjectAttribute to match ostring
#                        against, instead of the defaults.
#        typeclass (str or TypeClass): restrict matches to objects having
#                  this typeclass. This will help speed up global searches.
#        candidates (list obj ObjectDBs): If supplied, search will only be
#                  performed among the candidates in this list. A common list
#                  of candidates is the contents of the current location.
#        exact (bool): Match names/aliases exactly or partially. Partial
#                  matching matches the beginning of words in the names/aliases,
#                  using a matching routine to separate multiple matches in
#                  names with multiple components (so "bi sw" will match
#                  "Big sword"). Since this is more expensive than exact
#                  matching, it is recommended to be used together with
#                  the objlist keyword to limit the number of possibilities.
#                  This keyword has no meaning if attribute_name is set.
