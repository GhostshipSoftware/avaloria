"""
These are actions for the dummy client runner, using
the default command set and intended for unmodified Evennia.

Each client action is defined as a function. The clients
will perform these actions randomly (except the login action).

Each action-definition function should take one argument- "client",
which is a reference to the client currently performing the action
Use the client object for saving data between actions.

The client object has the following relevant properties and methods:
  cid - unique client id
  istep - the current step
  exits - an empty list. Can be used to store exit names
  objs - an empty list. Can be used to store object names
  counter() - get an integer value. This counts up for every call and
              is always unique between clients.

The action-definition function should return the command that the
client should send to the server (as if it was input in a mud client).
It should also return a string detailing the action taken. This string is
used by the "brief verbose" mode of the runner and is prepended by
"Client N " to produce output like "Client 3 is creating objects ..."

This module *must* also define a variable named ACTIONS. This is a tuple
where the first element is the function object for the action function
to call when the client logs onto the server.  The following elements
are 2-tuples (probability, action_func), where probability defines how
common it is for that particular action to happen. The runner will
randomly pick between those functions based on the probability.

ACTIONS = (login_func, (0.3, func1), (0.1, func2) ... )

To change the runner to use your custom ACTION and/or action
definitions, edit settings.py and add

 DUMMYRUNNER_ACTIONS_MODULE = "path.to.your.module"
