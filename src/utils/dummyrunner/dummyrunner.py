Dummy client runner

This module implements a stand-alone launcher for stress-testing
an Evennia game. It will launch any number of fake clients. These
clients will log into the server and start doing random operations.
Customizing and weighing these operations differently depends on
which type of game is tested. The module contains a testing module
for plain Evennia.

Please note that you shouldn't run this on a production server!
Launch the program without any arguments or options to see a
full step-by-step setup help.

Basically (for testing default Evennia):

 - Use an empty/testing database.
 - set PERMISSION_PLAYER_DEFAULT = "Builders"
 - start server, eventually with profiling active
 - launch this client runner

If you want to customize the runner's client actions
(because you changed the cmdset or needs to better
match your use cases or add more actions), you can
change which actions by adding a path to

   DUMMYRUNNER_ACTIONS_MODULE = <path.to.your.module>

in your settings. See utils.dummyrunner_actions.py
for instructions on how to define this module.

Usage: dummyrunner.py [-h][-v][-V] [nclients]

DO NOT RUN THIS ON A PRODUCTION SERVER! USE A CLEAN/TESTING DATABASE!

This stand-alone program launches dummy telnet clients against a
running Evennia server. The idea is to mimic real players logging in
and repeatedly doing resource-heavy commands so as to stress test the
game. It uses the default command set to log in and issue commands, so
if that was customized, some of the functionality will not be tested
(it will not fail, the commands will just not be recognized).  The
running clients will create new objects and rooms all over the place
as part of their running, so using a clean/testing database is
strongly recommended.

Setup:
  1) setup a fresh/clean database (if using sqlite, just safe-copy
     away your real evennia.db3 file and create a new one with
     manage.py)
  2) in game/settings.py, add

        PERMISSION_PLAYER_DEFAULT="Builders"

  3a) Start Evennia like normal.
  3b) If you want profiling, start Evennia like this instead:

        python runner.py -S start

     this will start Evennia under cProfiler with output server.prof.
  4) run this dummy runner:

        python dummyclients.py <nr_of_clients> [timestep] [port]

     Default is to connect one client to port 4000, using a 5 second
     timestep.  Increase the number of clients and shorten the
     timestep (minimum is 1s) to further stress the game.

     You can stop the dummy runner with Ctrl-C.

  5) Log on and determine if game remains responsive despite the
     heavier load. Note that if you do profiling, there is an
     additional overhead from the profiler too!
  6) If you use profiling, let the game run long enough to gather
     data, then stop the server. You can inspect the server.prof file
     from a python prompt (see Python's manual on cProfiler).
