"""
This file contains the core methods for the Batch-command- and
Batch-code-processors respectively. In short, these are two different
ways to build a game world using a normal text-editor without having
to do so 'on the fly' in-game. They also serve as an automatic backup
so you can quickly recreate a world also after a server reset. The
functions in this module is meant to form the backbone of a system
called and accessed through game commands.

The Batch-command processor is the simplest. It simply runs a list of
in-game commands in sequence by reading them from a text file. The
advantage of this is that the builder only need to remember the normal
in-game commands. They are also executing with full permission checks
etc, making it relatively safe for builders to use. The drawback is
that in-game there is really a builder-character walking around
building things, and it can be important to create rooms and objects
in the right order, so the character can move between them. Also
objects that affects players (such as mobs, dark rooms etc) will
affect the building character too, requiring extra care to turn
off/on.

The Batch-code processor is a more advanced system that accepts full
Python code, executing in chunks. The advantage of this is much more
power; practically anything imaginable can be coded and handled using
the batch-code processor. There is no in-game character that moves and
that can be affected by what is being built - the database is
populated on the fly. The drawback is safety and entry threshold - the
code is executed as would any server code, without mud-specific
permission checks and you have full access to modifying objects
etc. You also need to know Python and Evennia's API. Hence it's
recommended that the batch-code processor is limited only to
superusers or highly trusted staff.


=======================================================================

Batch-command processor file syntax

The batch-command processor accepts 'batchcommand files' e.g
'batch.ev', containing a sequence of valid evennia commands in a
simple format. The engine runs each command in sequence, as if they
had been run at the game prompt.

Each evennia command must be delimited by a line comment to mark its
end.

#INSERT path.batchcmdfile - this as the first entry on a line will
      import and run a batch.ev file in this position, as if it was
      written in this file.

This way entire game worlds can be created and planned offline; it is
especially useful in order to create long room descriptions where a
real offline text editor is often much better than any online text
editor or prompt.

Example of batch.ev file:
----------------------------

# batch file
# all lines starting with # are comments; they also indicate
# that a command definition is over.

@create box

# this comment ends the @create command.

@set box/desc = A large box.

Inside are some scattered piles of clothing.


It seems the bottom of the box is a bit loose.

# Again, this comment indicates the @set command is over. Note how
# the description could be freely added. Excess whitespace on a line
# is ignored.  An empty line in the command definition is parsed as a \n
# (so two empty lines becomes a new paragraph).

@teleport #221

# (Assuming #221 is a warehouse or something.)
# (remember, this comment ends the @teleport command! Don'f forget it)

# Example of importing another file at this point.
#IMPORT examples.batch

@drop box

# Done, the box is in the warehouse! (this last comment is not necessary to
# close the @drop command since it's the end of the file)
-------------------------

An example batch file is game/gamesrc/commands/examples/batch_example.ev.


==========================================================================


Batch-code processor file syntax

The Batch-code processor accepts full python modules (e.g. "batch.py")
that looks identical to normal Python files with a few exceptions that
allows them to the executed in blocks. This way of working assures a
sequential execution of the file and allows for features like stepping
from block to block (without executing those coming before), as well
as automatic deletion of created objects etc. You can however also run
a batch-code python file directly using Python (and can also be de).

Code blocks are separated by python comments starting with special
code words.

#HEADER - this denotes commands global to the entire file, such as
          import statements and global variables. They will
          automatically be pasted at the top of all code
          blocks. Observe that changes to these variables made in one
          block is not preserved between blocks!
#CODE
#CODE (info)
#CODE (info) objname1, objname1, ... -
           This designates a code block that will be executed like a
           stand-alone piece of code together with any #HEADER
           defined. (info) text is used by the interactive mode to
           display info about the node to run.  <objname>s mark the
           (variable-)names of objects created in the code, and which
           may be auto-deleted by the processor if desired (such as
           when debugging the script). E.g., if the code contains the
           command myobj = create.create_object(...), you could put
           'myobj' in the #CODE header regardless of what the created
           object is actually called in-game.
#INSERT path.filename - This imports another batch_code.py file and
          runs it in the given position.  paths are given as python
          path. The inserted file will retain its own HEADERs which
          will not be mixed with the HEADERs of the file importing
          this file.

The following variables are automatically made available for the script:

caller - the object executing the script
