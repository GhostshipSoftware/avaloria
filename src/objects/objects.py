"""
This is the basis of the typeclass system.

The idea is have the object as a normal class with the
database-connection tied to itself through a property.

The instances of all the different object types are all tied to their
own database object stored in the 'dbobj' property.  All attribute
get/set operations are channeled transparently to the database object
as desired. You should normally never have to worry about the database
abstraction, just do everything on the TypeClass object.

That an object is controlled by a player/user is just defined by its
'user' property being set.  This means a user may switch which object
they control by simply linking to a new object's user property.

        This is the root typeclass object, representing all entities
        that have an actual presence in-game. Objects generally have a
        location. They can also be manipulated and looked at. Most
        game entities you define should inherit from Object at some distance.
        Evennia defines some important subclasses of Object by default, namely
        Characters, Exits and Rooms (see the bottom of this module).

        Note that all new Objects and their subclasses *must* always be
        created using the ev.create_object() function. This is so the
        typeclass system can be correctly initiated behind the scenes.


        Object Typeclass API:

        * Available properties (only available on *initiated* typeclass objects)

         key (string) - name of object
         name (string) - same as key
         aliases (list of strings) - aliases to the object. Will be saved to
                     database as AliasDB entries but returned as strings.
         dbref (int, read-only) - unique #id-number. Also "id" can be used.
         dbobj (Object, read-only) - link to database model. dbobj.typeclass
                     points back to this class
         typeclass (Object, read-only) - this links back to this class as an
                     identified only. Use self.swap_typeclass() to switch.
         date_created (string) - time stamp of object creation
         permissions (list of strings) - list of permission strings

         player (Player) - controlling player (if any, only set together with
                          sessid below)
         sessid (int, read-only) - session id (if any, only set together with
                          player above)
         location (Object) - current location. Is None if this is a room
         home (Object) - safety start-location
         sessions (list of Sessions, read-only) - returns all sessions
                     connected to this object
         has_player (bool, read-only)- will only return *connected* players
         contents (list of Objects, read-only) - returns all objects inside
                         this object (including exits)
         exits (list of Objects, read-only) - returns all exits from this
                     object, if any
         destination (Object) - only set if this object is an exit.
         is_superuser (bool, read-only) - True/False if this user is a superuser

        * Handlers available

         locks - lock-handler: use locks.add() to add new lock strings
         db - attribute-handler: store/retrieve database attributes on this
                                 self.db.myattr=val, val=self.db.myattr
         ndb - non-persistent attribute handler: same as db but does not
                                 create a database entry when storing data
         scripts - script-handler. Add new scripts to object with scripts.add()
         cmdset - cmdset-handler. Use cmdset.add() to add new cmdsets to object
         nicks - nick-handler. New nicks with nicks.add().

        * Hook methods

                                Object customizations go here.
         at_object_delete() - called just before deleting an object. If
                              returning False, deletion is aborted. Note that
                              all objects inside a deleted object are
                              automatically moved to their <home>, they don't
                              need to be removed here.

                                  just after disconnecting player<->object link
         at_server_reload()   - called before server is reloaded
         at_server_shutdown() - called just before server is fully shut down

         announce_move_from(destination)  - called in old location, just before
                                            move, if obj.move_to() has

                                       for that call. The return of this
                                       method does not affect the result of the
                                       lock check.

         at_msg_send(self, msg, to_obj=None, data=None) - called when this
                             objects sends a message to someone via self.msg().

         return_appearance(looker) - describes this object. Used by "look"

                              by "location" keyword.
        use_nicks (bool): Use nickname-replace (nicktype "object") on the
                          search string
        typeclass (str or Typeclass): Limit search only to Objects with this
                          typeclass. May be a list of typeclasses for a
                          broader search.
        location (Object): Specify a location to search, if different from the
                          self's given location
                   plus its contents. This can also be a list of locations.

                        instead of object.key.
        quiet (bool) - don't display default error messages - return multiple

                              Turning off this keyword allows objects to move
                              "inside" exit objects.
