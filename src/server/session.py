    This class represents a player's session and is a template for
    both portal- and server-side sessions.

    Each connection will see two session instances created:

     1) A Portal session. This is customized for the respective connection
        protocols that Evennia supports, like Telnet, SSH etc. The Portal
        session must call init_session() as part of its initialization. The
        respective hook methods should be connected to the methods unique
        for the respective protocol so that there is a unified interface
        to Evennia.
     2) A Server session. This is the same for all connected players,
        regardless of how they connect.

    The Portal and Server have their own respective sessionhandlers. These
    are synced whenever new connections happen or the Server restarts etc,
    which means much of the same information must be stored in both places
    e.g. the portal can re-sync with the server when the server reboots.
