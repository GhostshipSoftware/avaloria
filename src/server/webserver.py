"""
This implements resources for twisted webservers using the wsgi
interface of django. This alleviates the need of running e.g. an
apache server to serve Evennia's web presence (although you could do
that too if desired).

The actual servers are started inside server.py as part of the Evennia
application.

(Lots of thanks to http://githup.com/clemensha/twisted-wsgi-django for
a great example/aid on how to do this.)
