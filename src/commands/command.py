    Base command

    Usage:
      command [args]

    This is the base command class. Inherit from this
    to create new commands.

    The cmdhandler makes the following variables available to the
    command methods (so you can always assume them to be there):
    self.caller - the game object calling the command
    self.cmdstring - the command name used to trigger this command (allows
                     you to know which alias was used, for example)
    cmd.args - everything supplied to the command following the cmdstring
               (this is usually what is parsed in self.parse())
    cmd.cmdset - the cmdset from which this command was matched (useful only
                seldomly, notably for help-type commands, to create dynamic
                help entries and lists)
    cmd.obj - the object on which this command is defined. If a default command,
                 this is usually the same as caller.

    The following class properties can/should be defined on your child class:

    key - identifier for command (e.g. "look")
    aliases - (optional) list of aliases (e.g. ["l", "loo"])
    locks - lock string (default is "cmd:all()")
    help_category - how to organize this help entry in help system
                    (default is "General")
    auto_help - defaults to True. Allows for turning off auto-help generation
    arg_regex - (optional) raw string regex defining how the argument part of
                the command should look in order to match for this command
                (e.g. must it be a space between cmdname and arg?)

    (Note that if auto_help is on, this initial string is also used by the
    system to create the help entry for the command, so it's a good idea to
    format it similar to this one)
