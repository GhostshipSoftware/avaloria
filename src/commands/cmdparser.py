    Parse number-identifiers.

    This parser will be called by the engine when a user supplies
    a search term. The search term must be analyzed to determine
    if the user wants to differentiate between multiple matches
    (usually found during a previous search).

    This method should separate out any identifiers from the search
    string used to differentiate between same-named objects. The
    result should be a tuple (index, search_string) where the index
    gives which match among multiple matches should be used (1 being
    the lowest number, rather than 0 as in Python).

    This parser version will identify search strings on the following

    This will be parsed to (2, "object") and, if applicable, will tell
    the engine to pick the second from a list of same-named matches of
    objects called "object".
