"""
Player (OOC) commands. These are stored on the Player object
and self.caller is thus always a Player, not an Object/Character.

These commands go in the PlayerCmdset and are accessible also
when puppeting a Character (although with lower priority)

These commands use the MuxCommandOOC parent that makes sure
to setup caller correctly. They use self.player to make sure
to always use the player object rather than self.caller (which
change depending on the level you are calling from)
The property self.character can be used to
access the character when these commands are triggered with
a connected character (such as the case of the @ooc command), it
is None if we are OOC.

Note that under MULTISESSION_MODE=2, Player- commands should use
self.msg() and similar methods to reroute returns to the correct
method. Otherwise all text will be returned to all connected sessions.
