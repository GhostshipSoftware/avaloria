Python ProcPool

Evennia Contribution - Griatch 2012

The ProcPool is used to execute code on a separate process. This allows for
true asynchronous operation. Process communication happens over AMP and is
thus fully asynchronous as far as Evennia is concerned.

The process pool is implemented using a slightly modified version of
the Ampoule package (included).

The python_process pool is a service activated with the instructions
in python_procpool_plugin.py.

To use, import run_async from this module and use instead of the
in-process version found in src.utils.utils. Note that this is a much
more complex function than the default run_async, so make sure to read
the header carefully.

To test it works, make sure to activate the process pool, then try the
following as superuser:

@py from contrib.procpools.python_procpool import run_async;run_async("_return('Wohoo!')", at_return=self.msg, at_err=self.msg)

You can also try to import time and do time.sleep(5) before the
_return statement, to test it really is asynchronous.

def run_async(to_execute, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Runs a function or executes a code snippet asynchronously.

    Inputs:
    to_execute (callable) - if this is a callable, it will
            be executed with *args and non-reserver *kwargs as
            arguments.
            The callable will be executed using ProcPool, or in
            a thread if ProcPool is not available.
    to_execute (string) - this is only available is ProcPool is
            running. If a string, to_execute this will be treated as a code
            snippet to execute asynchronously. *args are then not used
            and non-reserverd *kwargs are used to define the execution
            environment made available to the code.

    reserved kwargs:
        'use_thread' (bool) - this only works with callables (not code).
                     It forces the code to run in a thread instead
                     of using the Process Pool, even if the latter
                     is available. This could be useful if you want
                     to make sure to not get out of sync with the
                     main process (such as accessing in-memory global
                     properties)
        'proc_timeout' (int) - only used if ProcPool is available. Sets a
                     max time for execution. This alters the value set
                     by settings.PROCPOOL_TIMEOUT
        'at_return' -should point to a callable with one argument.
                    It will be called with the return value from
                    to_execute.
        'at_return_kwargs' - this dictionary which be used as keyword
                             arguments to the at_return callback.
        'at_err' - this will be called with a Failure instance if
                       there is an error in to_execute.
        'at_err_kwargs' - this dictionary will be used as keyword
                          arguments to the at_err errback.
        'procpool_name' - the Service name of the procpool to use.
                          Default is PythonProcPool.

    *args   - if to_execute is a callable, these args will be used
              as arguments for that function. If to_execute is a string
              *args are not used.
    *kwargs - if to_execute is a callable, these kwargs will be used
              as keyword arguments in that function. If a string, they
              instead are used to define the executable environment
              that should be available to execute the code in to_execute.

    run_async will either relay the code to a thread or to a processPool
    depending on input and what is available in the system. To activate
    Process pooling, settings.PROCPOOL_ENABLE must be set.

    to_execute in string form should handle all imports needed. kwargs
    can be used to send objects and properties. Such properties will
    be pickled, except Database Objects which will be sent across
    on a special format and re-loaded on the other side.

    To get a return value from your code snippet, Use the _return()
    function: Every call to this function from your snippet will
    append the argument to an internal list of returns. This return value
    (or a list) will be the first argument to the at_return callback.

    Use this function with restrain and only for features/commands
    that you know has no influence on the cause-and-effect order of your
    game (commands given after the async function might be executed before
    it has finished). Accessing the same property from different
    threads/processes can lead to unpredicted behaviour if you are not
    careful (this is called a "race condition").

    Also note that some databases, notably sqlite3, don't support access from
    multiple threads simultaneously, so if you do heavy database access from
    your to_execute under sqlite3 you will probably run very slow or even get
    tracebacks.
