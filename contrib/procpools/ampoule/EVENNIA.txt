AMPOULE
-------

https://launchpad.net/ampoule

AMPoule is a process management system using Twisted spawnProcess
functionality. It uses AMP to pipe messages to a process Pool that it
manages. The service is called ProcPool in Evennia settings.

AMPoule's very good, but unfortunately the source is very poorly
documented.  Hence the source in this directory does not comform to
Evennia's normally rigid standards - for now we try to edit it as
little as possible so as to make it easy to apply upstream updates
down the line. 

Changes made by Evennia are minor - it's mainly limiting spam to the
log and an added ability to turn this on/off through settings. Most
Evennia related code are found in src/server/procpool.py and
src/server/server.py.
