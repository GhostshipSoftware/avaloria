Python ProcPool plugin

Evennia contribution - Griatch 2012

This is a plugin for the Evennia services. It will make the service
and run_async in python_procpool.py available to the system.

To activate, add the following line to your settings file:

SERVER_SERVICES_PLUGIN_MODULES.append("contrib.procpools.python_procpool_plugin")

Next reboot the server and the new service will be available.

If you want to adjust the defaults, copy this file to
game/gamesrc/conf/ and re-point
settings.SERVER_SERVICES_PLUGINS_MODULES to that file instead.  This
is to avoid clashes with eventual upstream modifications to this file.

It is not recommended to use this with an SQLite3 database, at least
if you plan to do many out-of-process database writes. SQLite3 does
not work very well with a high frequency of off-process writes due to
file locking clashes. Test what works with your mileage.
